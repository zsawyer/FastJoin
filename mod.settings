description = [=[This mod shortens the update delay for auto joining server from 10 seconds to 1 second.

It will also ping on each refresh to let you know that auto-joining is still in progress. Once you start connecting a tone will signify that you are loading in now (not that this might get cut short if your PC is really fast with loading). This comes in handy when you are doing something else while waiting.]=]
